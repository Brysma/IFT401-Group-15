    <h2>Our story</h2>
    <br>
    <p>FurEver dog started as an idea between four team members; Bryce Ungersma, Joesph Benjamin, Tracey Baker, and Adrian Marquez.The orignal memebers wanted to find a solution,
    to help others find their perfect dog companions. Based on personal expriences the team notice that people tend to select breads that might require, more attention
  then some people are able to give. Although poeple might like particular dog breeds, they might be better off finding a companion that best matches their personalities.
 Every dog has its own charcter no matter the breed,but the team thought <br> of creating a website that can help narrow down the search for the best suited canine friend. </p>
